		#LOC_Trivarion_Planets_Trivarion_displayName = Trivarion^N
		#LOC_Trivarion_Planets_Trivarion_description = Trivarion is what happens when a gas giant, a death metal album cover, and a mid-life crisis all collide. With colors so intense they scare away photons and storms angrier than a Kerbal who forgot his snacks, Trivarion dominates the sky like it owns the place (because it kinda does). Scientists say it's tidally bullying half its moons — but Trivarion says it's just 'motivating them to be molten.' Approach with caution, cool shades, and a very good heat shield.

                #LOC_Trivarion_Planets_Susan_displayName = Susan^N
		#LOC_Trivarion_Planets_Susan_description = "She may be dry, dusty, and dead inside—but so are most Kerbals after accounting meetings.” Orbiting the mighty ringed gas giant Kerosa, Susan is the moon that time forgot and dust remembered. Its cracked terrain, crusty sky, and total lack of moisture make it the perfect place for roasting your rover, drying out snacks, and ruining your lander's suspension. Come for the view—stay because your ascent engine clogged with sand. Again.
		
		#LOC_Trivarion_Biome1 = Equatorial Bands
		#LOC_Trivarion_Biome2 = North Polar Bands
		#LOC_Trivarion_Biome3 = North Temperate Bands
		#LOC_Trivarion_Biome1 = North Equatorial Bands

                #LOC_Susan_Biome1 = Midlands
                #LOC_Susan_Biome2 = Lowlands
                #LOC_Susan_Biome3 = Highlands

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = The crew reports that the Equatorial Bands are too metal to describe. One Kerbal insists he heard growling.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = Polar view: confirmed. Also confirmed: frostbite on a gas giant is somehow possible.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = These clouds are swirling in anger. Probably mad we forgot sunscreen.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = The crew is unsure if they’re in orbit or inside an album cover.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = The south seems slightly less angry. Only *slightly.*
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_crewReport_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = Visibility is low, spirits are lower. Welcome to the South Pole.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = The Goo™ turned black and started screaming. Mission control recommends never doing that again.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = The Goo™ froze, boiled, then blinked at us. Concerning.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = The Goo™ now glows faintly. That’s probably fine.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = The Goo™ tried to escape. We let it.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = It solidified, re-liquefied, then turned into a tiny screaming face.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mysteryGoo_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = The Goo™ is now ice-cold and whispering. It knows your name.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = The sample tray caught fire and the backup tray turned philosophical. Science!
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = A reaction occurred. It involved frostbite, static cling, and panic.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = Data suggests these materials were not designed for metal planet atmospheres.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = Some of the metals melted. Others developed opinions.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = The readings are in: extremely volatile, mildly offended.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_mobileMaterialsLab_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = The lab now hums at 60 Hz and blames you.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = Surface temperature: lava-flavored. Good luck.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = The thermometer briefly became a plasma torch.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = Scanned a thermal gradient and got a heatstroke.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = Temperature rising... rising... rising—*pop!*
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = Cooling trend detected. Still extremely not safe.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_temperatureScan_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = Temperature nominal. If “nominal” means 900°C.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = Gravitational field is angry and uneven. Just like Trivarion.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = Gravity seems to spike here. Possibly lifting sarcasm to a new height.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = Gravity report: erratic. Possibly rebellious.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = Scan indicates the mass here might be flexing on us.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = Consistent with tidal bullying from the gas giant.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_gravityScan_TrivarionInSpaceLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = Readings normal. If you ignore the warping spacetime.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome1 = Composition: mostly anger, some vapor, and a splash of spite.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome2 = Analysis complete. It smells like ozone and sarcasm.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome3 = High metal content in the clouds. Rock on.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome4 = The gas mix is confusing. Possibly on purpose.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome5 = Air's not breathable unless you’re a fire elemental.
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_atmosphereAnalysis_TrivarionFlyingLow_Trivarion_Biome6 = Sample returned an error, and then a warning, and then caught fire.

		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_infraredTelescope_TrivarionInSpaceHigh = This gas planet has some pretty tasty colors! Oh crap! It has an eye!
		#LOC_Trivarion_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeTrivarion = This gas planet has some pretty tasty colors! Oh crap! It has an eye!
