## TO INSTALL:

1. Begin with an installation of KSP version 1.12.1 or newer, running in 64-bit.

   * Kopernicus\
   * ModularFlightIntergrator\
   * ModuleManager

5. Download Trivarion_System 0.0.1

6. Copy from `[Trivarion Download]\GameData\` to `[KSP]\GameData\` the folder `Trivarion\` and all its contents.

8. Copy from `[Textures Download]\GameData\Trivarion\` to `[KSP]\GameData\Trivarion\` the folder `Trivarion_Textures\`.
